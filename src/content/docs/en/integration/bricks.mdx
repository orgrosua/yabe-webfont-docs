[Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/) is a visual site builder for WordPress. Bricks allow you to build a beautiful site with unmatched performance, design, and customizability.

Yabe Webfont is fully featured and working great with Bricks. The built-in integration gives you the native experience of using custom fonts in Bricks.

## Using custom fonts in the Bricks

You can use any [Custom Font](/en/font/custom-font), embedding [Adobe Fonts](/en/font/adobe-fonts) or [self-hosting Google Fonts](/en/font/google-fonts) in the Bricks and cross-platform.

### Step 1: Choose the text element

Choose the text element by clicking on the canvas or the Structure panel.

## Disable the Google Fonts in Bricks

Bricks use the Google Fonts Web API to provide users with the Google Fonts collection. To be GDPR compliant, you must disable the Google Fonts in Bricks.

Yabe Webfont forcibly disables the Google Fonts in Bricks by taking reference from the [official documentation](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/filter-bricks-assets-load_webfonts/), so you don't need to do anything.
